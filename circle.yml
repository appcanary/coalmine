# tests fail when missing the bundled file
# atm we don't test javascript so let's punt
# on building the thing - just get the tests
# to run:

dependencies:
  pre:
    - touch app/assets/javascripts/main.bundle.js

test:
  post:
    - bundle exec rake appcanary:check
    - bundle exec rake appcanary:update_monitor

# machine:
#   node:
#     version: 0.10.26
# 
# dependencies:
#   pre:
#     - npm install
#     - npm run webpack-bundle
