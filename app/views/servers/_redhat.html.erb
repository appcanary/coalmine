<h4>Add our repo, and install the package</h4>
<p>Open a shell on your favourite server. The following script adds our repository to your apt sources, and installs our package:
  <kbd>curl -s https://appcanary.com/servers/rpm.sh | sudo bash</kbd>
  <br/>
  We know <code>curl http://foo | bash</code>sucks, and we're sorry. We're working on it. Click <a href="https://appcanary.com/servers/rpm.sh">here</a> to read it before running it.
</p>

<h4>Edit the configuration</h4>
<p>Now edit the configuration. 
  <br/>
  <kbd>vim /etc/appcanary/agent.conf</kbd>
  <br/>
  You're going to need to add your API key, so feel free to copy and paste the following:
  <br/>
  <pre>
api_key = "<%= @agent_token %>"

# Fill in your Ruby app's path and 
# uncomment the next two lines:

#[[files]]
#path = "/var/www/someapp/current/Gemfile.lock"

#[[files]]
#path = "/var/www/anotherapp/current/Gemfile.lock"
</pre>
  Finally, point the config file to your <code>Gemfile.lock</code> using its full qualified path.
</p>

<h4>Let's get started</h4>
<p>Start the agent:
  <br/>
  <kbd>sudo start appcanary</kbd><br/> or<br/>
  <kbd>sudo systemctl start appcanary</kbd>
</p>
