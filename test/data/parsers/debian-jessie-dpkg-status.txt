Description: GTK+-2-based PIN or pass-phrase entry dialog for GnuPG
 This package contains a program that allows for secure entry of PINs or
 pass phrases.  That means it tries to take care that the entered
 information is not swapped to disk or temporarily stored anywhere.
 This functionality is particularly useful for entering pass phrases
 when using encryption software such as GnuPG or e-mail clients using
 the same.  It uses an open protocol and is therefore not tied to
 particular software.
 .
 The program contained in this package implements a PIN entry dialog
 using the GTK+ tool kit version 2, so it is especially suitable for
 users of GNOME.  If the X Window System is not active then an
 alternative text-mode dialog will be used.  There are sibling packages
 that implement PIN entry dialogs using other tool kits.

Description: Cairo 2D vector graphics library
 Cairo is a multi-platform library providing anti-aliased
 vector-based rendering for multiple target backends. Paths consist

 with various join and cap styles. All colors may be specified with
 optional translucence (opacity/alpha) and combined using the
 extended Porter/Duff compositing algebra as found in the X Render
 Extension.
 .
 Cairo exports a stateful rendering API similar in spirit to the path

 need to be (re)created, and issues the commands to (re)create
 them. Make can be used to organize any task in which targets (files)
 are to be automatically updated based on input files whenever the
 corresponding input is newer --- it is not limited to building
 computer programs. Indeed, Make is a general purpose dependency

Description: module for using IPv4 and IPv6 sockets in a protocol-independent way
 IO::Socket::IP provides a protocol-independent way to use IPv4 and IPv6
 sockets. It allows new connections to be made by specifying the hostname and
 service name or port number. It allows for connections to be accepted by
 sockets listening on local ports, by service name or port number.
 .
 It uses Socket::GetAddrInfo's getaddrinfo function to convert
 hostname/service name pairs into sets of possible addresses to connect to.
 This allows it to work for IPv6 where the system supports it, while still
 falling back to IPv4-only on systems which don't.
 .
 It provides an API which, for most typical cases, should be a drop-in
 replacement for IO::Socket::INET; most constructor arguments and methods are
 provided in a compatible way.

 The XCB library provides an interface to the X Window System protocol,
 designed to replace the Xlib interface.  XCB provides several advantages over
 Xlib:
 .
  * Size: small library and lower memory footprint
  * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later
  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking
  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from
    machine-parsable protocol descriptions

 future versions will be smart like that. Port 465 is usually what you want,

 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or

 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel
 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the asymmetric cryptographic algorithms, which,
 require the GNU multiple precision arithmetic library (libgmp) for
 their large integer computations.

 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the
 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

Description: GRand Unified Bootloader, version 2 (PC/BIOS binaries)
 GRUB is a portable, powerful bootloader.  This version of GRUB is based on a
 cleaner design than its predecessors, and provides the following new features:
 .
  - Scripting in grub.cfg using BASH-like syntax.
  - Support for modern partition maps such as GPT.
  - Modular generation of grub.cfg via update-grub.  Packages providing GRUB
    add-ons can plug in their own script rules and trigger updates by invoking
    update-grub.
  - VESA-based graphical mode with background image support and complete 24-bit
    color set.
  - Support for extended charsets.  Users can write UTF-8 text to their menu
    entries.
 .
 This package contains a version of GRUB that has been built for use with
 traditional PC/BIOS architecture.  It will not automatically install GRUB
 as the active boot loader, nor will it automatically update grub.cfg on
 upgrade, so most people should install grub-pc instead.

 (such as Python docstrings), for quickly creating simple web pages, and for
 standalone documents.
 .
 The purpose of the Docutils project is to create a set of tools for
 processing reStructuredText documentation into useful formats, such as HTML,
 LaTeX, ODT or Unix manpages.

Description: GNU time program for measuring CPU resource usage
 The 'time' command runs another program, then displays information
 about the resources used by that program, collected by the system while
 the program was running.  You can select which information is reported
 and the format in which it is shown, or have 'time' save the information
 in a file instead of display it on the screen.
 .
 The resources that 'time' can report on fall into the general
 categories of time, memory, I/O, and IPC calls.
 .
 The GNU version can format the output in arbitrary ways by using a
 printf-style format string to include various resource measurements.

Description: configuration for the Exim MTA (v4)
 Exim (v4) is a mail transport agent. exim4-config provides the configuration
 for the exim4 daemon packages. The configuration framework has been split
 off the main package to allow sites to replace the configuration scheme
 with their own without having to change the actual exim4 packages.
 .
 Sites with special configuration needs (having a lot of identically
 configured machines for example) can use this to distribute their own
 custom configuration via the packaging system, using the magic
 available with dpkg's conffile handling, without having to do local
 changes on all of these machines.
 .
 The Debian exim4 packages have their own web page,
 http://wiki.debian.org/PkgExim4. There is also a Debian-specific
 FAQ list. Information about the way the Debian packages are
 configured can be found in
 /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/README.Debian.gz, which additionally contains
 information about the way the Debian binary packages are built. The
 very extensive upstream documentation is shipped in
 /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/spec.txt.gz. To repeat the debconf-driven
 configuration process in a standard setup, invoke dpkg-reconfigure
 exim4-config. There is a Debian-centered mailing list,
 pkg-exim4-users@lists.alioth.debian.org. Please ask Debian-specific
 questions there, and only write to the upstream exim-users mailing
 list if you are sure that your question is not Debian-specific. You

 style cookies described in RFC 2965. The two variants of cookies are supposed
 to be able to coexist happily.
 .
 Instances of the class HTTP::Cookies are able to store a collection of
 Set-Cookie2: and Set-Cookie: headers and are able to use this information to
 initialize Cookie-headers in HTTP::Request objects. The state of a

Description: utility to determine the locale encoding
 In many applications it's wise to let Perl use Unicode for the strings it
 processes. Most of the interfaces Perl has to the outside world are still byte
 based. Programs therefore need to decode byte strings that enter the program
 from the outside and encode them again on the way out.
 .
 The POSIX locale system is used to specify both the language conventions
 requested by the user and the preferred character set to consume and output.
 The Encode::Locale module looks up the charset and encoding (called a CODESET
 in the locale jargon) and arranges for the Encode module to know this encoding
 under the name "locale". It means bytes obtained from the environment can be
 converted to Unicode strings by calling Encode::encode(locale => $bytes) and
 converted back again with Encode::decode(locale => $string).

 privileges to users and log root activity.  The basic philosophy is to give
 as few privileges as possible but still allow people to get their work done.
 .
 This version is built with minimal shared library dependencies, use the
 sudo-ldap package instead if you need LDAP support for sudoers.

 level of interest and reliability depending on the manufacturer. This will
 often include usage status for the CPU sockets, expansion slots (e.g. AGP, PCI,
 ISA) and memory module slots, and the list of I/O ports (e.g. serial, parallel,
 USB).
 .
 Beware that DMI data have proven to be too unreliable to be blindly trusted.
 Dmidecode does not scan the hardware, it only reports what the BIOS told it to.

Description: Vera font family derivate with additional characters
 DejaVu provides an expanded version of the Vera font family aiming for
 quality and broader Unicode coverage while retaining the original Vera
 style. DejaVu currently works towards conformance with the Multilingual
 European Standards (MES-1 and MES-2) for Unicode coverage. The DejaVu
 fonts provide serif, sans and monospaced variants.
 .
 This package only contains the sans, sans-bold, serif, serif-bold,
 mono and mono-bold variants. For additional variants, see the
 ttf-dejavu-extra package.
 .
 DejaVu fonts are intended for use on low-resolution devices (mainly
 computer screens) but can be used in printing as well.

 bsd-mailx is the traditional simple command-line-mode mail user agent.
 Even if you don't use it, it may be required by other programs.
 .
 The /usr/bin/mail command provided by this package is a very simple one,
 and does not include many features that can be found in more advanced
 mail user agents.
 .
 For example bsd-mailx DOES NOT support:
  - MIME           (i.e. no attachments, no UTF-8 or other charsets support);
  - SMTP protocol  (/usr/sbin/sendmail interface only is used);
  - POP3/IMAP      (bsd-mailx reads local mailboxes only);
  - maildir format (traditional mbox only format is supported).
 .
 If the above features are needed, please consider installing another package
 providing similar /usr/bin/mail interface:
  - heirloom-mailx package,
  - or mailutils package.

 Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
 Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.) Mawk conforms
 to the POSIX 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
 which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk
 provides a small number of extensions.
 .
 Mawk is smaller and much faster than gawk. It has some compile-time
 limits such as NF = 32767 and sprintf buffer = 1020.

Description: Text::Unidecode -- US-ASCII transliterations of Unicode text
 It often happens that you have non-Roman text data in Unicode, but
 you can't display it -- usually because you're trying to
 show it to a user via an application that doesn't support Unicode,
 or because the fonts you need aren't accessible.  You could
 represent the Unicode characters as "???????" or
 "\15BA\15A0\1610...", but that's nearly useless to the user who
 actually wants to read what the text says.
 .
 What Text::Unidecode provides is a function, unidecode(...) that
 takes Unicode data and tries to represent it in US-ASCII characters
 (i.e., the universally displayable characters between 0x00 and
 0x7F).  The representation is
 almost always an attempt at transliteration -- i.e., conveying,
 in Roman letters, the pronunciation expressed by the text in
 some other writing system.  (See the example in the synopsis.)

 you don't use it directly. Once the module is installed LWP is able to access
 sites using HTTP over SSL/TLS.
 .
 If hostname verification is requested by LWP::UserAgent's ssl_opts, and
 neither SSL_ca_file nor SSL_ca_path is set, then SSL_ca_file is implied to be
 the one provided by ca-certificates.
 .
 This module used to be bundled with libwww-perl, but it was unbundled in
 v6.02 in order to be able to declare its dependencies properly for the CPAN
 tool-chain. Applications that need HTTPS support can just declare their
 dependency on LWP::Protocol::https and will no longer need to know what
 underlying modules to install.

 GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage.
 It can be used to encrypt data and to create digital signatures.
 It includes an advanced key management facility and is compliant
 with the proposed OpenPGP Internet standard as described in RFC 4880.
 .
 GnuPG 1.4 is the standalone, non-modularized series. In contrast to
 the version 2 series, shipped with the gnupg2 package, it comes
 with no support for S/MIME and some other tools useful for desktop
 environments, but also with less dependencies.
 .
 The gnupg package is built without libcurl. So it does not support
 HKPS keyservers. Install the gnupg-curl package if you want to use
 the keyserver helper tools built with libcurl and supporting HKPS.

Description: Core Perl modules
 Architecture independent Perl modules.  These modules are part of Perl and
 required if the `perl' package is installed.
 .
 Note that this package only exists to save archive space and should be
 considered an internal implementation detail of the `perl' package.
 Other packages should not depend on `perl-modules' directly, they
 should use `perl' (which depends on `perl-modules') instead.

Description: quickly find files on the filesystem based on their name
 mlocate is a new implementation of locate, a tool to find files
 anywhere in the filesystem based on their name, using a fixed pattern
 or a regular expression. Unlike other tools like find(1), locate uses
 a previously created database to perform the search, allowing queries
 to execute much faster. This database is updated periodically from
 cron.
 .
 Several implementations of locate exist: the original implementation
 from GNU's findutils, slocate, and mlocate. The advantages of mlocate
 are:
 .
  * it indexes all the filesystem, but results of a search will only
    include files that the user running locate has access to. It does
    this by updating the database as root, but making it unreadable for
    normal users, who can only access it via the locate binary. slocate
    does this as well, but not the original locate.
 .
  * instead of re-reading all the contents of all directories each time
    the database is updated, mlocate keeps timestamp information in its
    database and can know if the contents of a directory changed without
    reading them again. This makes updates much faster and less demanding
    on the hard drive. This feature is only found in mlocate.
 .
 Installing mlocate will change the /usr/bin/locate binary to point to
 mlocate via the alternatives mechanism. After installation, you may
 wish to run /etc/cron.daily/mlocate by hand to create the database,
 otherwise mlocate won't work until that script is run from cron itself
 (since mlocate does not use the same database file as standard locate).
 Also, you may wish to remove the "locate" package in order not to have
 two different database files updated regularly on your system.

Description: conservative garbage collector for C and C++
 Boehm-Demers-Weiser's GC is a garbage collecting storage allocator that is
 intended to be used as a plug-in replacement for C's malloc or C++'s new().
 .
 It allows you to allocate memory basically as you normally would without
 explicitly deallocating memory that is no longer useful. The collector
 automatically recycles memory when it determines that it can no longer be
 used.
 .
 This version of the collector is thread safe, has C++ support and uses the
 defaults for everything else. However, it does not work as a drop-in malloc(3)
 replacement.

Description: simple http server class
 Instances of the HTTP::Daemon class are HTTP/1.1 servers that listen on a
 socket for incoming requests. The HTTP::Daemon is a subclass of
 IO::Socket::INET, so you can perform socket operations directly on it too.
 .
 The accept() method will return when a connection from a client is available.
 The returned value will be an HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn object which is
 another IO::Socket::INET subclass. Calling the get_request() method on this
 object will read data from the client and return an HTTP::Request object. The
 ClientConn object also provide methods to send back various responses.
 .
 This HTTP daemon does not fork(2) for you. Your application, i.e. the user of
 the HTTP::Daemon is responsible for forking if that is desirable. Also note
 that the user is responsible for generating responses that conform to the
 HTTP/1.1 protocol.

Description: support files for all Exim MTA (v4) packages
 Exim (v4) is a mail transport agent. exim4-base provides the support
 files needed by all exim4 daemon packages. You need an additional package
 containing the main executable. The available packages are:
 .
  exim4-daemon-light
  exim4-daemon-heavy
 .
 If you build exim4 from the source package locally, you can also
 build an exim4-daemon-custom package tailored to your own feature set.
 .
 The Debian exim4 packages have their own web page,
 http://wiki.debian.org/PkgExim4. There is also a Debian-specific
 FAQ list. Information about the way the Debian packages are
 configured can be found in
 /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/README.Debian.gz, which additionally contains
 information about the way the Debian binary packages are built. The
 very extensive upstream documentation is shipped in
 /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/spec.txt.gz. To repeat the debconf-driven
 configuration process in a standard setup, invoke dpkg-reconfigure
 exim4-config. There is a Debian-centered mailing list,
 pkg-exim4-users@lists.alioth.debian.org. Please ask Debian-specific
 questions there, and only write to the upstream exim-users mailing
 list if you are sure that your question is not Debian-specific. You
 can find the subscription web page on

Description: high-quality block-sorting file compressor library - runtime
 This package contains libbzip2 which is used by the bzip2 compressor.
 .
 bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data compressor.
 It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available
 techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six
 times faster at decompression.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

Description: Update Configuration File(s): preserve user changes to config files
 Debian policy mandates that user changes to configuration files must be
 preserved during package upgrades. The easy way to achieve this behavior
 is to make the configuration file a 'conffile', in which case dpkg
 handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as
 needed.
 .
 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
 version that will work for most installations, although some system
 administrators may choose to modify it. This implies that the
 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
 any other time).
 .
 This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that
 may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,
 but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to
 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
 provides for 'conffiles'.
 .
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
 file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come
 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
 installation time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
 conffile status.

 automatically set their network configuration. If your machine
 depends on DHCP (especially likely if it's a workstation on a large
 network, or a laptop, or attached to a cable modem), keep this or
 another DHCP client installed.

 times faster at decompression.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

Description: Font rendering engine for Complex Scripts -- library
 Graphite is a system that can be used to create and use "smart fonts" capable
 of displaying writing systems with various complex behaviors, such as:
 contextual shaping, ligatures, reordering, split glyphs, bidirectionality,
 stacking diacritics and complex positioning.
 .
 This library was designed and developed by the NRSI (Non-Roman Script
 Initiative) within SIL International (www.sil.org) to act as a complement to
 other smart font rendering technologies with limited practical local
 extensibility. Its purpose is to help meet the needs of a very large number
 of "minority language" communities for local extensibility of complex script
 behaviors.
 .
 The behavior of the rendering engine for a given writing system is specified
 through extra tables added to a TrueType font.  These tables are generated by
 compiling a GDL (Graphite Description Language) source file into a font using
 grcompiler.
 .

Description: Larry Wall's Practical Extraction and Report Language
 Perl is a highly capable, feature-rich programming language with over
 20 years of development. Perl 5 runs on over 100 platforms from
 portables to mainframes. Perl is suitable for both rapid prototyping
 and large scale development projects.
 .
 Perl 5 supports many programming styles, including procedural,
 functional, and object-oriented. In addition to this, it is supported
 by an ever-growing collection of reusable modules which accelerate
 development. Some of these modules include Web frameworks, database
 integration, networking protocols, and encryption. Perl provides
 interfaces to C and C++ for custom extension development.

Description: secure shell (SSH) server, for secure access from remote machines
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It can be used to provide applications with a secure communication
 channel.
 .
 This package provides the sshd server.
 .
 In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all
 without a special permit.
 .
 sshd replaces the insecure rshd program, which is obsolete for most
 purposes.

Description: low level cryptographic library (symmetric and one-way cryptos)
 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or
 less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,
 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel
 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the symmetric and one-way cryptographic
 algorithms. To avoid having this package depend on libgmp, the
 asymmetric cryptos reside in a separate library, libhogweed.

 XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
 compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful
 compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.
 .
 This package provides the command line tools for working with XZ
 compression, including xz, unxz, xzcat, xzgrep, and so on. They can
 also handle the older LZMA format, and if invoked via appropriate
 symlinks will emulate the behavior of the commands in the lzma
 package.
 .
 The XZ format is similar to the older LZMA format but includes some
 improvements for general use:
 .
  * 'file' magic for detecting XZ files;
  * crc64 data integrity check;
  * limited random-access reading support;
  * improved support for multithreading (not used in xz-utils);
  * support for flushing the encoder.

Description: system and service manager
 systemd is a replacement for sysvinit.  It is dependency-based and
 able to read the LSB init script headers in addition to parsing rcN.d
 links as hints.
 .
 It also provides process supervision using cgroups and the ability to
 not only depend on other init script being started, but also
 availability of a given mount point or dbus service.
 .
 Installing the systemd package will not switch your init system unless you
 boot with init=/bin/systemd or install systemd-sysv in addition.

Description: collection of modules that parse HTML text documents
 HTML::Parser is a collection of modules useful for handling HTML documents.
 These modules used to be part of the libwww-perl distribution, but are now
 unbundled in order to facilitate a separate development track.
 .
 Objects of the HTML::Parser class will recognize markup and separate it from
 content data. As different kinds of markup are recognized, the corresponding
 event handler is invoked. The document to be parsed may also be supplied in
 arbitrary chunks, making on-the-fly parsing of network documents possible.

Description: Perl module for parsing XML files
 The XML::Parser module provides ways to parse XML documents.  It is built on
 top of XML::Parser::Expat, which is a lower level interface to James Clark's
 expat library. Each call to one of the parsing methods creates a new instance
 of XML::Parser::Expat which is then used to parse the document. Expat options
 may be provided when the XML::Parser object is created. These options are
 then passed on to the Expat object on each parse call. They can also be given
 as extra arguments to the parse methods, in which case they override options
 given at XML::Parser creation time.
 .
 The behavior of the parser is controlled either by Style and/or Handlers
 options, or by setHandlers method. These all provide mechanisms for
 XML::Parser to set the handlers needed by XML::Parser::Expat. If neither
 Style nor Handlers are specified, then parsing just checks the document for
 being well-formed.
 .
 When underlying handlers get called, they receive as their first parameter
 the Expat object, not the Parser object.

Description: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web
 using HTTP(S) and FTP, the two most widely used internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as FTP
 sites -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both HTTP and FTP) that support it. Both HTTP and FTP
 retrievals can be time stamped, so Wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

Description: Emulate IO::File interface for in-core strings
 The IO::String module provide the IO::File interface for in-core
 strings.  An IO::String object can be attached to a string, and
 will make it possible to use the normal file operations for reading or
 writing data, as well as seeking to various locations of the string.
 The main reason you might want to do this, is if you have some other
 library module that only provide an interface to file handles, and you
 want to keep all the stuff in memory.
 .
 The IO::String module provide an interface compatible with
 IO::File as distributed with IO-1.20, but the following methods
 are not available; new_from_fd, fdopen, format_write,
 format_page_number, format_lines_per_page, format_lines_left,
 format_name, format_top_name.

Description: module to find differences between files
 Algorithm::Diff is a Perl module that allows users to analyze text based on a
 Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm. It can compare two files and find
 the differences between them, which can produce the same information as the
 common Unix tool 'diff'.
 .
 There is an XS-optimized implementation of the core loop, which accelerates
 some types of diff output (see libalgorithm-diff-xs-perl).

  * Size: small library and lower memory footprint
  * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later
  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking
  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from
    machine-parsable protocol descriptions

Description: File comparison utilities
 The diffutils package provides the diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp programs.
 .
 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file
 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where
 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

 it. Some meta-data will automatically be added for you, like a timestamp and
 a stack trace, but some can be filled in by the user, like a tag by which to
 identify it or group it, and a level at which to handle the message (for
 example, log it, or die with it)
 .
 Log::Message also provides a powerful way of searching through items by
 regexes on messages, tags and level.

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (daemon and utilities)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 This package contains the D-Bus daemon and related utilities.
 .
 The client-side library can be found in the libdbus-1-3 package, as it is no
 longer contained in this package.

 Ispell corrects spelling in plain text, LaTeX, sgml/html/xml, and nroff files.
 [x]Emacs and jed have nice interfaces to ispell, and ispell works from many
 other tools and from the command line as well.
 .
 No ispell dictionaries are included in this package; you must install
 at least one of them ("iamerican" is recommended by default for no good
 reason); install the "ispell-dictionary" package(s) for the language(s)
 you and your users will want to spell-check.
 .
 It's a good idea to install "word list" package(s) for the same language(s),
 because they'll be used by ispell's (L)ookup command.

Description: framework for building and installing Perl modules
 Module::Build is a framework for easily building, testing and installing Perl
 packages. It is meant as a next-generation replacement for ExtUtils::MakeMaker
 and offers many additional features characteristic of a more modern install
 system, including simple subclassing for custom build actions.
 .
 Because it is written in Pure Perl, it has very few external dependencies. In
 particular, it allows for installation of packages on systems without 'make'
 and will even work without a shell. Its only prerequisites are modules that
 are included with perl 5.6.0 and it is core as of perl 5.10.

 Libevent is an asynchronous event notification library that provides a
 mechanism to execute a callback function when a specific event occurs
 on a file descriptor or after a timeout has been reached.
 .
 It is meant to replace the asynchronous event loop found in
 event driven network servers. Currently, libevent supports /dev/poll,
 kqueue(2), event ports, select(2), poll(2) and epoll(4).
 .
 For backward compatibility and to transition to "libevent_core only"
 or "libevent_core + libevent_extra", the libevent source package builds
 the libevent library that includes everything in libevent_core and
 libevent_extra.

 /etc/deluser.conf 773fb95e98a27947de4a95abb3d3f2a2
Description: add and remove users and groups
 This package includes the 'adduser' and 'deluser' commands for creating
 and removing users.
 .
  - 'adduser' creates new users and groups and adds existing users to
    existing groups;
  - 'deluser' removes users and groups and removes users from a given
    group.
 .
 Adding users with 'adduser' is much easier than adding them manually.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, and automate setting
 initial values for the user's password, real name and so on.
 .
 Deluser can back up and remove users' home directories
 and mail spool or all the files they own on the system.
 .
 A custom script can be executed after each of the commands.

Description: secure shell (SSH) client, for secure access to remote machines
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It can be used to provide applications with a secure communication
 channel.
 .
 This package provides the ssh, scp and sftp clients, the ssh-agent
 and ssh-add programs to make public key authentication more convenient,
 and the ssh-keygen, ssh-keyscan, ssh-copy-id and ssh-argv0 utilities.
 .
 In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all
 without a special permit.
 .
 ssh replaces the insecure rsh, rcp and rlogin programs, which are
 obsolete for most purposes.

Description: process scheduling daemon
 The cron daemon is a background process that runs particular programs at
 particular times (for example, every minute, day, week, or month), as
 specified in a crontab. By default, users may also create crontabs of
 their own so that processes are run on their behalf.
 .
 Output from the commands is usually mailed to the system administrator
 (or to the user in question); you should probably install a mail system
 as well so that you can receive these messages.
 .
 This cron package does not provide any system maintenance tasks. Basic
 periodic maintenance tasks are provided by other packages, such
 as checksecurity.

Description: minimalistic Netlink communication library
 libmnl is a minimalistic user-space library oriented to Netlink developers.
 There are a lot of common tasks in parsing, validating, constructing of
 both the Netlink header and TLVs that are repetitive and easy to get wrong.
 This library aims to provide simple helpers that allows you to re-use code
 and to avoid re-inventing the wheel.
 .
 The main features of this library are:
 .
 Small: the shared library requires around 30KB for an x86-based computer.
 .
 Simple: this library avoids complexity and elaborated abstractions that
 tend to hide Netlink details.
 .
 Easy to use: the library simplifies the work for Netlink-wise developers.
 It provides functions to make socket handling, message building,
 validating, parsing and sequence tracking, easier.
 .
 Easy to re-use: you can use the library to build your own abstraction
 layer on top of this library.
 .
 Decoupling: the interdependency of the main bricks that compose the
 library is reduced, i.e. the library provides many helpers, but the
 programmer is not forced to use them.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries needed to run programs that use
 the minimalistic Netlink communication library.

 xdg-user-dirs is a tool to help manage "well known" user directories
 like the desktop folder and the music folder. It also handles
 localization (i.e. translation) of the filenames.
 .
 The way it works is that xdg-user-dirs-update is run very early in the
 login phase. This program reads a configuration file, and a set of
 default directories. It then creates localized versions of these
 directories in the users home directory and sets up a config file in
 $(XDG_CONFIG_HOME)/user-dirs.dirs (XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to
 ~/.config) that applications can read to find these directories.

  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking

Description: SELinux library for manipulating binary security policies
 Security-enhanced Linux is a patch of the Linux kernel and a number
 of utilities with enhanced security functionality designed to add
 mandatory access controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux
 kernel contains new architectural components originally developed to
 improve the security of the Flask operating system. These
 architectural components provide general support for the enforcement
 of many kinds of mandatory access control policies, including those
 based on the concepts of Type Enforcement®, Role-based Access
 Control, and Multi-level Security.
 .
 libsepol provides an API for the manipulation of SELinux binary policies.
 It is used by checkpolicy (the policy compiler) and similar tools, as well
 as by programs like load_policy that need to perform specific transformations
 on binary policies such as customizing policy boolean settings.

 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 The daemon can be found in the dbus package.

Recommends: libxml-sax-expat-perl
Description: Perl module for using and building Perl SAX2 XML processors
 XML::SAX consists of several framework classes for using and
 building Perl SAX2 XML parsers, filters, and drivers.  It is designed
 around the need to be able to "plug in" different SAX parsers to an
 application without requiring programmer intervention.  Those of you
 familiar with the DBI will be right at home.  Some of the designs
 come from the Java JAXP specification (SAX part), only without the
 javaness.
 .
 The package also contains a SAX parser, XML::SAX::PurePerl, but it
 is considered too slow for serious use and is only provided as a
 fallback parser. It is recommend XML::SAX::Expat (provided in
 libxml-sax-expat-perl) instead.
 .
 The framework includes a Debian-specific script (called
 update-perl-sax-parsers) to manage the ParserDetails.ini file. This
 script is intended to be used in postinst and prerm package scripts to
 (de)register parsers.  See README.Debian for more info.

Description: Perl module to access CPAN distributions metadata
 Software distributions released to the CPAN include a META.json or, for older
 distributions, META.yml which describes the distribution, its contents, and
 the requirements for building and installing the distribution. The data
 structure stored in the META.json file is described in CPAN::Meta::Spec.
 .
 CPAN::Meta provides a simple class to represent this distribution metadata
 (or distmeta), along with some helpful methods for interrogating that data.
